Final Result: You asked: What are the issues with the sunroof leakage?

Based on the provided SQL query and the empty results, it appears there is no information available in the `fresh-span-400217.warranty.qnps_embedding` table about sunroof leakage issues. This suggests that either:

1. **There are no reported cases of sunroof leakage in the database.** This could be because the issue is rare, or perhaps the database doesn't capture all types of warranty claims.
2. **The data is not properly tagged or categorized.**  It's possible that sunroof leakage issues are described using different terms in the database, and the query is not capturing them all.

**Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to your question based on the available data.** To get a more complete understanding of sunroof leakage issues, you may need to:

* **Review other data sources:**  Check for information about sunroof leakage in other databases or reports.
* **Refine the query:**  Consider using different search terms or broadening the scope of the query to capture more potential cases.
* **Contact customer support:**  Reach out to the relevant customer support team for information on reported sunroof leakage issues.
